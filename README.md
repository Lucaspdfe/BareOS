# BareOS

Hello, this is my project, BareOS, a Barebones Operating System, everything is built from scratch, so no GRUB or Limine.

## Development

I am in school, so there may be pauses in development. I'll try to keep it as updated as possible.

## Q&A

Q: Why suffer with what is the hell of OSDev?   A: I don't know, got tired of web and game development and wanted to suffer.

Q: Why BareOS?                                  A: It's the combination between Barebones and OS (Operating System), pretty explanatory.

Q: How do I test?                               A: Every release, there will be a HDD (.img) image you can boot using a virtual machine or even in a real computer.

Q: Will you keep it real hardware friendly?     A: I will try to do so. Not guaranteeing.
